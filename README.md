## Best Practices for Writing Issues

To ensure your issue is clear and actionable, here are some best practices:

1. **Be Specific**  
   Try to be as specific as possible about the problem or suggestion. If you're reporting a bug, describe exactly what happened, including steps to reproduce.

2. **Include Screenshots/Logs**  
   When applicable, providing screenshots, error messages, or log files can greatly help in diagnosing issues.

3. **Link to Relevant Issues**  
   If your issue is related to an existing one, link to it in your issue description. This helps us avoid duplicates and ensures better context.

4. **Keep it Focused**  
   If you have multiple issues, please create separate issues for each one. This keeps discussions focused and manageable.

5. **Use Descriptive Titles**  
   Provide a clear, concise title for your issue that summarises the core problem or request.
